Readme:
~~~~~~~
This is a (simple) DayStats script for glftpd, written in perl.
(dds = dax Daystats Script or dax DayStats, originally the latter)

Its originally made for zs-c's sitebot, but can be made to fit any
sitebot easily. I've tried to make it as costumizable as possible,
and as easy to config as possible without breaking costumizability.
You should not have a need to edit script, and dont whine to me if
you do it unless you are competent enough to know what you are doing
when/if you break it ;)

It only requires two modules, Data::Dumper and FindBin, both which 
should be included in your perl distribution :)

Installing:
~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Put it in a nice dir (f.x. /glftpd/bin/) together with .conf (cp dds.* /glftpd/bin/)
2) Chmod it to eXecutable (chmod 750 /glftpd/bin/dds.pl)
2) Edit dds.conf and read comments carefully
3) Run it with debug to see if its working (/glftpd/bin/dds.pl debug)
4) Add announce to sitebot output (see below for dZSbot.tcl)
5) Add it to crontab, something like "9 23 * * * /glftpd/bin/dds.pl" (crontab -e)

(dZSbot.tcl:
add "DSTATS" to msgtypes(DEFAULT)
set disable(DSTATS) 0
set variables(DSTATS) "%msg"
set announce(DSTATS) "(\002DSTATS\002) %msg" (change to what you want)
and rehash it :-)

Running it:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Run it with parameter "debug" to run it in "debug mode", which displays
config options and shows output to screen INSTEAD of to bot, or run it
with a regex date to match that date instead of this. 
(f.x. say Jan 01 2003, you can specify one or all parameters, in any order,
 but month = 3 letters, date = 1 or 2 digits and year = 4 digits)
(Debug mode does *not* write anything to file, and does *not* parse %c & %b)

Contact me via email (daxxar@daxxar.com) if you have feedback and I'll
probably respond :) (i. e. find bugs, want features, criticism)
(Btw, my code is horrible, I know!)
