# psxc-mp3fetch v0.1
# ==================
#
# A small, simple util to read the id3 header of a mp3 and give you the info.
# Meant to be used in conjunction with prescripts etc that do not have the
# ability to fetch the id3 header themselves.
#
# To compile: gcc -W -Wall -O2 -static -g -o /glftpd/bin/psxc-mp3fetch mp3fetch.c
#
# Usage: psxc-mp3fetch /path/to/filename.mp3
#
# Output: <name of artist>|<name of title>|<name of album>|<year>|<genre>|<bitrate>|<cbr or vbr>
#
# How to grab the information you want is up to you.
# As an example, here's how to extract the genre in bash:
#
# > psxc-mp3fetch /path/to/filename.mp3 | cut -d '|' -f 5
