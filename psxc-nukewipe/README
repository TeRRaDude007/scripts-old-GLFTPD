# psxc-nukewipe v0.3 - by psxc(C)2006
# ==================
# 
# Small script/binary to help remove nuked releases. May be used as a channel
# command (!nukewipe) or as a crontabbed script.
# The script takes two args - number of hours old the nuke must be before
# it can be wiped, and an optional path arg, to only remove nukes according to
# path.
#
# First, edit psxc-nukewipe.c - there's a few options that needs to be correct
# in order for the script to work.
#
# To compile, do:
#   gcc -g -W -O2 -Wall -static -o /glftpd/bin/psxc-nukewipe psxc-nukewipe.c
#
# On 64bit processors you need to add -m32:
#   gcc -g -W -m32 -O2 -Wall -static -o /glftpd/bin/psxc-nukewipe psxc-nukewipe.c
#
# If the bin is to be run by bot or crontabbed as non-root, the bin needs +s:
#   chmod +s /glftpd/bin/psxc-nukewipe
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# If you want botsupport, copy psxc-nukewipe.tcl to your eggdrop scripts/ dir.
# Then edit scripts/psxc-nukewipe.tcl according to your wishes.
#
# To make your bot announce, add the following to the pzs-ng version of dZSbot:
#
# in dZSbot.conf, add the following:
#   set disable(NWIPE)        0
#   set redirect(NWIPE)       $staffchan
#
# in dZSbot.conf.defaults, add NWIPE to the list of msgtypes(SECTION)
#
# in dZSbot.vars, add the following:
#   set variables(NWIPE)        "%pf %releasename %size"
#
# in default.zst (or whatever theme you use), add the following:
#   announce.WIPE             = "[%b{nwipe }][%section] %b{%relname} (%b{%size}MB) got wiped."
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Usage:   psxc-nukewipe [--test|--help] <hours> [path]
#          hours  : nuked dirs older than <hours> hours will be wiped.
#          path   : (minimum) path to match (optional).
#
# Examples: psxc-nukewipe 72 /site/incoming/0DAY/ <- remove nukes in 0DAY older than 3 days.
#           psxc-nukewipe 72 */0DAY/*             <- remove nukes in 0DAY older than 3 days.
#           psxc-nukewipe --test 5                <- fake a nukewipe of anything older than 5 hours.
#           psxc-nukewipe --help                  <- this screen.
