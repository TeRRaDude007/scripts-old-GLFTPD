README for psxc-unpack and psxc-unpack_all
==========================================

These scripts were made by request. What they do is unrar files, keeping the
dir structure. It should be "safe" - only the rar-files found initially will
be removed after a successful unpacking - ie, if the unpacking fails, no files
will be removed. Also, if there are rar files within a rar archive (like with
subs) the new rar file(s) will not be removed.

A testmode is on by default, meaning no files will be extracted, and no files
will be removed. This to help you test before putting it "live".

The main script (psxc-unpack.sh) will scan current dir, if the script is run
chroot'ed (either as a site command or by a zipscript), and extract the dirs
logged in a special logfile when not run chroot'ed, or run with a special
"magic word" under chroot.

The additional script, psxc-unpack_all.sh, will scan recursively certain dirs,
adding dirs that has been complete to the logfile mentioned above.
After all is done, it will start the unpack procedure (running the main script).

If it encounters rar-files in subdirs (subs/ , cd1/ , dvd3/ etc), it will
extract the file(s) to parent dir. Also, if the subdir is empty (not counting
the COMPLETE dir/file and any files starting with a dot, like .message), it
will try to delete the entire subdir. This is, ofcourse, optional.

Enjoy.
