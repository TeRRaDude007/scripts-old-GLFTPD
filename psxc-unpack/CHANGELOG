psxc-unpack changelog
---------------------

v1.0 - First official release.
v1.1 - Fixed a bug when extracting from subdirs - if the rarfile(s) in a subdir
       contained another (set of) rar-file(s), which was named the same as the
       one(s) in the main dir, the files in the main dir would be overwritten.
     - Removed (redirected) an "error" message complaining about being unable
       to remove files that was not there. We don't care about that.
v1.2 - Fixed an issue regarding files/dirs with spaces - seen especially if the
       complete-dir had spaces, and was suppoesed to be removed after unpack.
v1.3 - Fixed more issues regarding spaces in dirnames.
v1.4 - Made it possible to disable the autodeleting of .001 files (mostly
       beneficial for XBOX360 DVD9 images)
v1.5 - Even more fixes with spaces in dirnames and filenames inside archive.
v1.6 - daxxar added support for skipdirs and edited the crontab line.
v2.0 - more or less a rewrite of the script - should be quicker and handle "bad"
       archives better (like archives with an identical named archive inside).
       Renamed SKIPDIRS to IGNOREDIRS (sorry daxxar)
v2.1 - Fixed bug with *.partXX.rar archives. Added support for zip-extraction.
v2.2 - Fixed newly introduced bug with normal .rar archives by changing default
       FILETYPES variable to "\.[Rr][Aa][Rr]$ \.001$". Fixed bug that caused
       errors to appear in STDOUT on last archive. Script now works in ANY dir
       when executed with the RUN_NOW trigger.
v2.3 - Another newly introduced bug squashed - now won't start automatically on
       last file uploaded in a release.
v2.4 - another bug gone, and support for a simple move-script.
v2.5 - added support for completescript - a script to be executed after
       successful unpacking of release.
v2.6 - fixed a small bug when trying to cd .. when pwd was deleted.
     - changed default SUBDIRS string to something better.
v2.7 - changed LOGDATEFORMAT to WAITSECONDS - this will let the script work
       on both BSD and Linux w/o changing vars.
v2.8 - fixed a typo when dealing with extended regexp (grep -e -> grep -E).
     - fixed small bugs in the default config when searching for dirs/files to
     - delete (complete-bar, dot-files etc)
v2.9 - fixed another typo related to WAITSECONDS - made the script unpack to
       early.
     - fixed a bug related to RMFILES - should now delete properly.
v2.10- fixed a bug related to zip-files with spaces in the filename.
v2.11- fixed a (long standing) bug related to partXX named files.
