psxc-unpack changelog
---------------------

v1.0 - First official release.

v1.1 - Fixed a bug when extracting from subdirs - if the rarfile(s) in a subdir
       contained another (set of) rar-file(s), which was named the same as the
       one(s) in the main dir, the files in the main dir would be overwritten.
     - Removed (redirected) an "error" message complaining about being unable
       to remove files that was not there. We don't care about that.
v1.2 - Fixed an issue regarding files/dirs with spaces - seen especially if the
       complete-dir had spaces, and was suppoesed t obe removed after unpack.
v1.3 - Fixed more issues regarding spaces in dirnames.
