psxc-unpack changelog
---------------------

v1.0 - First official release.
v1.1 - Fixed a bug when extracting from subdirs - if the rarfile(s) in a subdir
       contained another (set of) rar-file(s), which was named the same as the
       one(s) in the main dir, the files in the main dir would be overwritten.
     - Removed (redirected) an "error" message complaining about being unable
       to remove files that was not there. We don't care about that.
v1.2 - Fixed an issue regarding files/dirs with spaces - seen especially if the
       complete-dir had spaces, and was suppoesed to be removed after unpack.
v1.3 - Fixed more issues regarding spaces in dirnames.
v1.4 - Made it possible to disable the autodeleting of .001 files (mostly
       beneficial for XBOX360 DVD9 images)
v1.5 - Even more fixes with spaces in dirnames and filenames inside archive.
v1.6 - daxxar added support for skipdirs and edited the crontab line.
v2.0 - more or less a rewrite of the script - should be quicker and handle "bad"
       archives better (like archives with an identical named archive inside).
       Renamed SKIPDIRS to IGNOREDIRS (sorry daxxar)
v2.1 - Fixed bug with *.partXX.rar archives. Added support for zip-extraction.
