This is my list of stuff to do. If you have an idea that should be placed in
in this file, please mail me @ psxc@psxc.com

1. Improve the dynamic section handling - currently it handles one section
   completely before moving to the next one. It should instead match file
   against section.

2. Add support to execute a script after removing/moving a dir. good for mp3-
   symlink handling.

3. Improve the archiving - if someone set up some weird archiving it may happen
   that the free space on the device is not enough for the stuff being moved.
   Checks should be added and actions performed to remedy this.
