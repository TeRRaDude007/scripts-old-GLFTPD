README FOR PSXC-FREE
--------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a simple, yet versatile freespace script. Unlike a lot of other
freespace script it does not have a lot of options, or advanced configs.
Yet it still does the basics for almost any site, namely remove the oldest
dir(s) when availible space is low, or move them to a different location.
There is no special dated dir options - you can mix dated and non-dated dirs
without concern.
Quota support is ofcourse present, giving you better control of how much
space should be used in each section. Quotas can be absolute or dynamic.


CONFIG
------
PATH              - The usual PATH variable. Should contain all dirs where
                    whatever bins it needs is stored.

GLROOT            - Full path to installdir of glftpd.

GLLOG             - Full path to glftpd.log

SITEDIR           - Full sitepath, usually /glftpd/site. I don't think this
                      warrants more explanation.

MDATE             - Included is a small bin the script uses to log the date
                    of dirs. Compile this by the compile.sh script.

USEGNUDATE        - The 'date' command differs on linux and *bsd. If you're
                    running this script on linux, you'll want to set this to
                    "YES".

TEMPDIR           - Files the script uses as tempfiles is places here.

TESTRUN           - While you test the script, keep this set to "YES". Nothing
                    will be removed - stuff that would have been removed will
                    be shown.

CREATEDATE        - If you set this to "YES" the script will try to create
                    today's dated dir if it does not already exists. It will
                    not create/update any symlink you have pointing at it/them.

EXCLUDES          - The following pattern of files is ignored by the script, and
                    will not be deleted. The pattern is an extended regex
                    pattern.
                    Example: "^#|\<^PRE\>|\<^GROUPS\>|^\-"

Next up follow device-specific variables. These are marked with a _# where # is
a number starting with 1 (not 0), signifying the device number.

DEVICENAME_#      - This is the device we check for freespace. Usually it is
                    /dev/something.
                    Examples: /dev/hda1 /dev/mapper/site

  MINFREE_#       - This the minimum amount of free space in megabytes allowed
                    on the device. If free space is less than this, the script
                    start working.
                    Examples: 2048 5192

  SETFREE_#       - Once we start removing stuff we won't stop until this amount
                    is availible. This var must be the same or higher than
                    the MINFREE_# variable.
                    Examples: 3096 5192

  DAYSBACK_#      - How big an archive do you have? This is listed in days. This
                    regards dated dirs only.
                    Example: 90

  DIRS_#          - Enter the sections the script should search for dirs to
                    remove. If you enter dated format, this will be used. For
                    non-dated dirs you should end with a /*, else the entire
                    dir will be considered part of what the script should
                    remove.
                    Syntax: <PATH>
                    Examples: "DIVX/*" and "/0DAY/%m%d"

                    If you wish to have some sort of quota setup, add a colon
                    and a size after the dir, like APPS/*:60G. 'M' and 'm'
                    signify megabytes, 'G' and 'g' is gigabytes, 'G' and 'g'
                    is gigabytes, 'P' and '%' is percentage of total diskspace,
                    'F' and 'f' is number of files allowed in section.
                    'M', 'G', 'T', 'P' and 'F' mark an section absolute - the
                    size given will be achieved no matter how much free space
                    the device have.
                    'm', 'g', 't', '%' and 'f' mark a section dynamic - unless
                    the device is under MINFREE_#, nothing will be removed.
                    If you do not specify a type of size after the number,
                    dynamic megabytes will be used.
                    Syntax: <PATH>:<SIZE>
                    Examples: "DIVX/*:50G" and "0DAY/%m%d:70%"

                    If you wish to archive dirs you need to add the dir to put
                    the archived items. You also should add a number after that
                    which signify the device the archive is on. If no number is
                    set, current devicenumber is used.
                    Syntax: <PATH>:<SIZE>:<ARCHIVEDIR>:<DEVICE_#>
                    <SIZE> and <DEVICE_#> is optional.
                    Examples: "DIVX/*:50G:MOVIES:6" and "0DAY/%m%d::ARCHIVE/%Y%m:2"


INSTALLATION
------------
Copy psxc-free.conf to /glftpd/etc and psxc-free.sh to /glftpd/bin, or have them
both in the same dir. Usually there's no need to edit psxc-find.sh - it'll let
you know if something's up.

To make it run, add it as a crontab entry, like this:

15,45 * * * * /glftpd/bin/psxc-free.sh >/glftpd/ftp-data/logs/psxc-free.log 2>&1

This will make the script run 2 times an hour, and log what it does and any
errors to a logfile.


A NOTE ABOUT ARCHIVING
----------------------
Archiving dirs is a somewhat difficult task, really. If you archive on your
site, put the device with the archive(s) LAST. It won't break anything if you
don't, or have archive devices spread all over, but the general rule-of-thumb
is to place the archive devices (destination devices that is) last.
The devices you wish to move FROM should be placed first. Again, more a
general rule-of-thumb than an absolute.


FINAL NOTE
----------
That's about it. Even though this is the very first release of the script, you
shouldn't expect a lot more features in future versions. The goal when i made
this script was to have an easy config.
